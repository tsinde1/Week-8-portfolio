# Week-8-portfolio reflection
The main goal for my project was to create a code that allowed my clients to view a 12-hour and 24-hor clock on their website rather than just the 12-hour clock. I particularly utilized the flowchart and followed the specific standard requirements, to obtain my object oriented application and applied logic to allow for user input. I enhanced my codee by using specific in line comments in describing the functionality of my code and using appropriate variables throughout my code. The main skills acquired in the designing of my code that made my program maintainable include ;understanding the importance of logic in relation to the application sequence of functions, displaying and enabling correct menu function options in the user menu and maximizing the use of industry standard best practices in designing my code.
